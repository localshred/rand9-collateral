Ok ok ok, please do. Wait, you're already here. Great, read on then!

> "Are you ready to rock?" &raquo; [Alive and well][song] by Rise Against from The Unraveling (before they sucked)

Once upon a time, I had a dream. That dream was to roll my own blog in [Rails][rails] and show the world the awesomeness that was me. And so I bought [rand9.com][rand9] with full intentions of launching my blog in a few days. Well, days turned into a week, a week into several weeks, several weeks into several months, etc.

At some point in the early going I realized I wasn't super close to deploying the blog, so I ended up building a simple static "Coming Soon" page (that did *not* have an "Under Construction" animated gif), stating some important things about me, including the tagline which read: **"Coming Soon-ish"**. Needless to say, that "soon-ish" has been much more "later-ish" than I anticipated, to the tune of 9 months-ish. At least, I think it's been that long, maybe longer. 

I won't go into details about the platform I'm now using, only that it's called ***Marley*** and it's super rad. I didn't roll it myself, but went with someone else's great idea and did a few mods here and there to suit my needs. I plan on following this post with a comprehensive look at *Marley*, and when I do I'll update this post with a link to that post. Whew.

I just want you *all* to know (you know who you are) that I am [once again blogging][wp-post], and this is my tech blog where I'll be adding programming/tech related content and keeping ya'll updated on the great projects I'm working on (yes, I do have a non-tech [personal blog][personal-blog]). Till then, I bid you adieu.

Oh, one more thing. If you'd like to subscribe to this blog (highly recommended), please click the **"RSS"** link in your browser address bar, or by choosing [RSS][rss] or [Email][email] updates.

Cheers!
