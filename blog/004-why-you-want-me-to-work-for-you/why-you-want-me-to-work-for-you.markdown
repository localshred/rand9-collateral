Quite often I'm approached by friends, family, or associates about building [insert application name here], or desinging the branding for [company xyz]. Up until a few weeks ago my response is generally somewhere along the lines of, "Thanks, but no thanks." All that has changed recently as I've decided to turn rand9 into a full-fledged client-work business. I'll be focusing on three areas of my expertise, detailed below, but if you have any work that falls outside of these lines, please don't hesitate to [contact me][email] and we can discuss your project.


### Web Application Development

I've been finagling web applications for the past 7 years in PHP, Java, and Ruby. On one hand, I've worked on horrible hack-job projects, often outsourced to India; "Apps" that you couldn't really call Apps at all. On the other hand, I've worked on beautifully crafted Object-oriented systems that were well thought out and cleanly implemented. In other words, I've been around the web application block a few times. I've seen enough to know what works well, what will most likely do the job, and what is doomed to failure. 

My application development experience leans almost exclusively towards framework-driven object architectures. It's a fancy way of saying, "I believe in and use extensively stable and up-to-date programming software and practices." I've custom-built everything from a simple blog to a PDF-processing Web-to-Print software engine that supports private-branded portals.

### Graphic Design

My software background is complemented beautifully by my design capabilities. I've been studying usability and design for over a decade, and have regularly put out logos, site designs, and print work for a variety of project scopes and mediums. I've designed posters for the Children's Miracle Network, Logos for several startup companies, and numerous site designs. I'm even available to design and build micro-layouts within an already designed site.

### Software Project Consultation

It may sound incredibly nerdy, but I ***love*** talking about software. I love to discuss the theory behind the implementation, to critique the pattern-flow of an object architecture, to assess the feasability of an object-relational mapper. In short, I love to talk about what makes a project successful for the Businesses as well as exciting for the Developers writing the code. If your project is headed off the track, you need another pair of eyes to determine what is going wrong and how to get back on the track.

### Other Project Needs

If you have any other projects that might not fit the molds above, feel free to [contact me][email] and I can assist or point you in the right direction (if I can).

### What are you waiting for? Let's build something awesome together!
